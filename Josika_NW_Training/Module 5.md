### **1) Capture and analyze ARP packets using Wireshark. Inspect the ARP request and reply frames, and discuss the role of the sender's IP and MAC address in these packets**
### **2) Using Packet Tracer, simulate an ARP spoofing attack. Analyze the behavior of devices on the network when they receive a malicious ARP response**
### **3) Manually configure static IPs on the client devices(like Pc or your mobile phone) and verify connectivity using ping**
### **4) Use Wireshark to capture DHCP Discover, Offer, Request, and Acknowledge messages and explain the process**
### **5) Given an IP address range of 192.168.1.0/24, divide the network into 4 subnets**
### **6) You are given three IP addresses: 10.1.1.1, 172.16.5.10, and 192.168.1.5**
  - **Task: Identify the class of each IP address (Class A, B, or C). What is the default subnet mask for each class?**
  - **Provide the range of IP addresses for each class**
### **7) In Cisco Packet Tracer, create a small network with multiple devices (e.g., 2 PCs and a router). Use private IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.x) on the PCs and configure the router to perform NAT to allow the PCs to access the internet**
  - **Task: Test the NAT configuration by pinging an external IP address from the PCs and capture the traffic using Wireshark**
  - **What is the source IP address before and after NAT**
